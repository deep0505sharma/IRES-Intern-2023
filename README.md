Additive manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D printing, has evolved as the next generation manufacturing technology. Market studies estimate that the sale of metal AM printers will increase by 48% and the revenue will increase by over 30% annually by the year 2023. The global nature of the manufacturing industry and distributed nature of the workforce require exposure to the work environment, technical capabilities and culture of different countries that partner in this sector. This project contributes to preparing a U.S. workforce capable of addressing the challenges of the global AM supply chain by giving U.S. students exposure to industrial-scale 3D printing operations and the AM research in leading educational institutions in India. New York University (NYU) is partnering with New York City College of Technology (City Tech), a designated Minority Serving Institution, for this effort. The project will engage and educate a wide range of stakeholders as the project builds capacity in the US workforce in the emerging field of AM.

This IRES Track 1 project plans to establish a summer research experience program between the USA and India. The focus of the project is on developing filaments and 3D printing parameters for new polymers and composite materials. An important component of the project is to introduce students to process scale up in the environment of a company that is a leading manufacturer of large print-bed 3D printers. Each year four undergraduate and two graduate students from the USA will travel to India for eight-week research experience. In addition, six graduate students from India, will be supported by India, will be involved in the program. The students will spend seven weeks in India and the eighth week at NYU in New York for presentation of their research, feedback and evaluation sessions and follow up activity planning. Participation of City Teach will ensure the broadening participation of underrepresented minority communities in the project.

## Models used

For the project, several models had to be used and were compared accordingly to get the most efficient model. Let me guide you through the several phases of the internship. These include_

# Summer Activity Record

For generating the question we used Flan-Alpaca-Large / Llama 2 which are open-source models but for them to be used we had to fine-tune them. This was done by using a custom dataset which was made for scratch. The dataset contained the type of question to be generated and then the question to be generated

The fine-tuning was a major huddle as using an untrained model would result in the question being used to not have depth to them. 

The link for the custom dataset is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8H9LTCcvwUZwM5rkI62FLiknmnl_as5Kw0jyJdGBBI/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8H9LTCcvwUZwM5rkI62FLiknmnl_as5Kw0jyJdGBBI/edit?usp=sharing)

# Project Report IRES

This was one of the biggest tasks that had to be handled. The model not only had to convert speech to text but it also had to be efficient enough for it to not cause a bottleneck. Thus we decided to use OpenAI's whisper model. With this model, we were able to convert speech to text.
